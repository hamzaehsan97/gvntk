            We are Vijay, Krista, Caleb and Hamza and Our Mission is to
            eliminate waste and connect people needing to get rid of items with
            people who are in need of items. People throw away or donate a lot
            of their unused goods not knowing if people in their community may
            be in need of those things. We are trying to make it easy for people
            to post their unused/old items to see if people in their community
            could use them before they donate them. This will help people who
            may not have the means to buy the items they need. You can post
            clothing like coats, jackets, casual and dressy outfits, unused
            school supplies like notebooks, writing utensils or binders, old
            furniture and items like futons, desks or bicycles and general
            hygiene products like feminine products, tooth brushes and paste and
            soap.
